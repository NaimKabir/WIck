# Investigating HMDA Data

Here I try to classify whether a mortgage application will be approved using features available in the HDMA database.

Helpful classes for loading in data can be found in `dataloader.py`.

Classes for quickly putting together experiments are in `experiment.py`.

Custom models like neural networks are in `custom_models.py`.

The main runnable script to walk through the steps I took to explore the data are in `main.py`.
